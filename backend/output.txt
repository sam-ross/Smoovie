pull yourself together
it's just water
it's a lot of water
come on
  you okay boss
  yeah i'm fine i just i just can't
i just can't stomach the water
  so you're my new partner
  that's right
not the best way to meet with my head
halfway down the toilet
doesn't exactly square with teddy daniels
the man the legend i'll give you that
the legend
what the hell are you boys smoking
out there in portland anyway
seattle
i came from the office in seattle
how long have you been with marshals
four years
  so you know how small it is
  sure
what about you you got a girl married
i was
she died
  jesus i didn't
  don't worry about it
there was a fire in our apartment
building while i was at work
four people died
it was the smoke that got her
not the fire so
  so that's important
  i'm sorry boss
where are my goddamn cigarettes
well here have one of mine
i could of sworn they were in my jacket
when i got on
government employees will rob you blind
thanks
they give you a briefing
about the institution before you left
all i know is it's a mental hospital
for the criminally insane
well if it was just folks running around
hearing voices
and chasing after butterflies
they wouldn't need us
  that's where we're headed
  yup
the other side of the island is rock bluffs
all the way down to the edge
of the water
the dock it's the
only way onor off
we will be casting off as soon as
you two are ashore
i'd appreciate if you'd hurry up about it
  why
  storm's coming
i've never seen a marshal's
badge before
i'm deputy warden
mcpherson gentlemen
welcome to shutter island
i'll be the one taking you up to ashecliffe
your boys seem a little on edge
mr mcpherson
right now marshal we all are
remember us for we too have
lived loved and laughed
electrified perimeter
how could you tell
i've seen something like it before
all right you gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give
but during the stay you will
obey protocol is that understood
absolutely
the red brick bulding on my right
is ward a the male ward
ward b the female ward is the one
on the left
ward c is that building on the bluffs
an old civil war fort
the most dangerous patients
are housed there
admittance to ward c is forbidden without
the written consent and
physical presence of both myself and dr cawly
is that understood
you act like insanity is catching
you are hereby required to surrending
your firearms
mr mcpherson we are duly appointed
federal marshals
we are required to carry our
firearms with us at all times
executive order 319 of the federal code of
penitentiaries states that
when inside the penitentiary
the offices of that institution
have final authority
gentlemen you will not get through
this gate with your firearms
okay now that the official stuff is done
come on boys
what do you say we go find dr cawley
so when did she escape this prisoner
i'm afraid that dr cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation
protocol
correctional officers at a mental institution
that's a weird sight
if you don't mind me saying
it's the only facility of it's kind in the us
even in the world
we take only the
most dangerous damaged patients
ones no other hospital can manage
and it's all due to dr cawley
he's created something really unique here
a hospital for people our society normally
id's gentlemen
show your badges gentlemen
dr cawley's been consulted
numerous times
  by scotland yard mi5 the oss
  why
what do you mean
what do the intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about
i guess you'll have to ask him
  marshal daniels
  doctor
marshal aule
  thank you deputy warden that will be all
  yes sir
pleasure gentlemen
he had a lot to say about you
mcpherson is a good man
he believes in the work we do here
and what would that be exactly
a moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care
pardon me doc
a what between what and what
those paintings are quite accurate
it used to be that the kind of patients we
deal with here
were shackled and left in their own filth
they were beaten as if whipping
them bloody would drive the psychosis out
we drove screws into their brains we submerged
them in icy water until they lost consciousness
or even drown
  and now
  we treat them
try to heal try to cure
and if this fails at least we provide them
with a measure of comfort in their lives calm
these are
all violent offenders right
they've hurt people
  murdered them in some cases
  in almost all cases yes
then personally doctor i'd have to
say screw their sense of calm
it's my job to treat my patients not
their victims i'm not here to judge
  so this female prisoner
  patient
excuse me patient
one rachel solando
  escaped sometime in the last 24 hours
  last night
between 10 and midnight
  is she considered dangerous
  you could say that
she killed all three of her children
she drowned them in the lake behind her house
she took them out one by one and held their
heads under until they died
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table
she ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by
and what about the husband
he died on the beaches of normandy
she is a war widow
she starved herself when first she came here
she insisted the children weren't dead
  sorry doctor you wouldn't happen to have an aspirin do you
  prone to headaches marshal
sometimes but today
  i'm a little more prone to seasickness
  ah dehydration
  you alright boss
  yes
in that case you're quite right
the simpler the better
thank you so much
rachel still believes
her children are alive
she also believes this place is her home
in the berckshires
you're kidding me
she's never once in two years acknowledged
that she is in an institution
she believes we're all
deliveryman milkman postal workers
to sustain the illusion that her children never died
she's created an elaborate fictional structure
she gives us all parts to play in that fiction
  so have you searched the grounds yet
  the warden and his men scoured the island
not a trace
what's more disturbing is we don't know
how she got out of her room
it was locked from the outside
and the only window is barred
it's as if she evaporated straight
through the walls
brought her right back here after
group therapy locked her in
i came back for a midnight round
and she was gone
seriously doctor how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her
i mean she's in a
mental institution right
seems like something you'd
notice from time to time
  how many pairs of shoes are the patients given
  two pairs
sanity is not a choice marshal
you can't just choose to get over it
so she left here barefoot
come on doc she couldn't get ten
yards in that terrain
marshal

well this is definitely rachel's
handwriting
  i have no idea what the law of 4 is though
  it's not a psychiatric term
i'm afraid not
who's 67
fuck if i know
i'd have to say that's quite
close to my clinical conclusion
so you think it's
random scribblings
oh no not at all rachel is smart
brilliant in fact
  this paper could be important
  excuse me doctor but
  we're gonna have to hold onto this
  of course
and you say she had to come through here
after lights out the orderlies play
cards in here
last night there were 7 men sitting
at the base of those stairs playing stud poker
yet somehow rachel managed
to slip past them
why
how she turns invisible
doctor we're gonna need access to personnel files
of all the medical staff
the nurses the guards the orderlies
  anyone who was working then
  we'll take your request under consideration
this is not a request doctor
this is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner
  patient
  patient
  has escaped now you will comply
  all i can say is that i will see what i can do
doctor we're gonna need to speak with the staff
do you understand
i'll assemble them in the
common room after dinner
if you have any further questions feel
free to join the deputy warden in the search
it's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water is freezing
the current was strong last night
the tide pushing in
she'd have drowned or been crushed on the
rocks and her body would have washed back up onshore
what about those caves down there
have you checked them
no way she could get there
the base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy live oak sumac
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick
you said it yourself marshal
she's got no shoes
all right
let's check the other side
  what's that tower
  it's an old lighthouse
the guards already searched inside it
  what's in there more patients
  sewage treatment facility
it's getting dark soon
i'm calling this off for the night
let's go boys
  you were on watch on the landing huh
  yeah
can't nobody get in or out of their room
in that corridor without me seeing
okay rachel solando
who else does she have to pass
to get down here
me
glen miga
  sir i didn't see nothing
  and you were at your post all night
yes but i didn't see a thing
glen
glen
tell me the truth
i maybe went to the bathroom
  what you breached protocol christ
  i wasn't gone more than a minute
all right let's back up here
let's all just back up
miss solando was put in
her room for lights out
does anybody here know what she did
before that
anyone
come on anyone anyone anyone
she was in a group therapy session
huh did anything unusual occur
define unusual
  excuse me
  it's a mental institution marshal
for criminally insane
usual isn't a big part of our day
i will rephrase
did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more
  let's say more memorable than
  normal
exactly
no i'm sorry
did mrs solando say anything
during group therapy
she was worried about the rain
and she hated the food here
complained constantly
last night included
so you were there
was there a doctor present
yes dr sheehan led the discussion
dr sheehan
yes he was running the session
he's rachels's primary
the psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care
we're gonna need to speak with dr sheehan
i'm afraid that won't be possible
he left on the ferry this morning
his vacation was already planned
he'd putting it off too long
you're in a state of lockdown
a dangerous patient has escaped
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation
of course he's a doctor
do you have the phone number for
where he's gone
hello hello
hello
is anybody there
i'm sorry sir but its all down
all the lines
the storm's hitting the
mainland like a hammer
if you get it working come find me immediately
the marshalls need to make an important call
yes sir
i'm afraid i have evening rounds in the wards
but i'll be having drinks and a cigar at
my house around 9
if you'd care to drop by
good we can talk then right
we have been talking marshal
gotta say i'm thinking i got
into the wrong line of public service
it is a little overwhelming
it was constructed during the civil war
the same time as the military fort
housing ward c
this is the original commander's quarters
and uncle sam got the bill
the commander was court martialed
i can see why
nice music who is that brahms
no
it's mahler
quite right marshal
forgive me gentlemen
my colleague dr jeremiah naehring
quartet for piano and strings
in a minor
  your poison gentlemen
  rye if you've got it
soda and ice please thanks
you don't indulge in alcohol
i am surprised
isn't it common for men in your
profession to imbibe
common enough
and yours
  i'm sorry
  your profession doctor psychiatry
i've always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks
not that i've noticed
what's that iced tea in your glass there
excellent marshal
you have outstanding defense mechanisms
you must be quite adept at interrogations hmm
men like you are my specialty
you know
men of violence
that's a hell of an assumption to make
no assumption not at all you misunderstand
me i said you are men of violence
i'm not accusing you of being violent men
that's quite different
please please edify us doctor
you both served overseas
not much of a stretch doc for all you know
we were both paper pushers over there
no you were not
since the schoolyard neither of
you has ever walked away from a physical conflict
not because you enjoy it but because retreat
wasn't something you considered an option
we weren't raised to run doc
ah yes raised
and who raised you marshal
me
wolves
very impressive defense mechanisms
do you believe in god marshal
i'm quite serious
that's rubbish
have you ever seen a death camp doctor

i have i was there for
the liberation of dakau
your english is very good almost flawless
his english is very good
you hit the consonants a tad hard though
you're german
  is legal immigration a crime marshal
  oh i don't know doctor you to tell us
now listen we're gonne need those files on sheehan
and the rest of staff as well
no personnel files will be released for you
period
  we're gonna need those files
  out of the question
bullshit out of the question
bullshit
who the hell is in charge here anyway huh
dr naehring acts as liaison to
our board of overseers
he relayed your request and it's been refused
refused they don't have the authority
to refuse and neither do you sir
marshal continue your investigation
and we will do all we can to help
this investigation is over
we're gonna file our reports
and hand it over to
  hoover's boys
  hoover's boys that's right
we'll be taking the ferry back in the morning
come on chuck
nice night
you'll be bunking in the orderlies quarter
hey boss we really packing it in
why
i guess i dunno i just
never really quit anything before
we haven't heard the truth once yet chuck
listen rachel solando did not slip out of
a locked cell barefoot without any help
i think she had alot of help
maybe cawley's sitting up in his mansion
right now
rethinking his whole attitude
  maybe in the morning
  you're bluffing
i didn't say that
i found a whole stack of these teddy
jesus are you ever sober anymore
i killed alot of people in the war
is that why you drink
are you real
no
she's still here
who
rachel
she never left
remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer teddy
we were so happy
she's here
you can't leave
i'm not gonna leave
i love you so much
  i'm just bones in a box teddy
  no
i am
you have to wake up
i won't go
you're here
i'm not
you have to face that
but she is
and so is he
who
laeddis
i have to go
no pleasejust let me hold you
  just a little bit longer
  oh teddy
you have to let me go
i can't
ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit
doctor
doctor doctor
we need to interview the patients who
were in rachel's group therapy session
i thought your investigation was finished
it's not like we can take the ferry
now was rachel receiving any
other treatment for her illnesses
do you know the state of the
mental health field these days gentlemen
no not a clue doctor
war
the old school believes in
surgical intervention
psychosurgery
procedures like the trans orbital lobotomy
some say the patients become reasonable docile
others say they become zombies
  and the new school
  psycho pharmacology
a new drug has just been approved
authority
which relaxes psychotic patients
you could say it tames them
  and which school are you in doc
  me
i have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect
listen to him
try and understand
you just might reach him
  these patients
  even these
what should be a last resort is 
becoming a first response
give them a pill put them in a corner
and it all goes away
rachel solando was on a combination of drugs
meant to keep her from becoming violent
but it was only intermittently effective
the greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done
was
is there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense doctor
look outside marshal
why do you think
next up is peter breen assaulted
his father's nurse with a broken glass
nurse survived but
her face permaanently disfigured
i can't wait
she'd smiles at me
she was so sweet
but i could see it in her eyes
she liked to be naked
to suck cock
okay mr breen
and then she asked me if she can have
a glass of water
alone in the kitchen
like that's no big deal
  why was that a big deal
  it was obvious
she wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it
mr breen
we need to ask you some questions okay
when i cut her she screamed
but
she scared me
what did she expect
interesting
but we are here to talk
rachel solando okay
rachel solando
did you know she had drowned her own kids
she drowned her kids
this is a sick fucking world
we live in i'll tell you that
you know what they should be gassed
all of them the retards the killers
the niggers you kill your own kid
gas the bitch
would you stop that
  a nurse
  please stop that
a nurse maybe maybe she had kids huh
a husband
just trying to make ends meet
to lead a normal life
and it says in your file that uh
you tore her face off didn't you
congratulations no more normal
for her not ever again no
do you know what she was afraid of
you
could you stop that please
stop that
please stop
you know a patient by the name of andrew laeddis
  i want to go back
  take him
i'll never get out of here
i'm not sure that i should
excuse me for saying this
  miss kearns
  misses
mrs kearns
but you seem
quite normal
i mean in comparison
with the other patients here
well i have my dark days
i suppose everybody does
the difference is that most people don't kill
their husbands with an axe
although personally i think if a
man beats you and fucks
half the women he sees
and no one will help you
axing him isn't the least understandable
thing you can do
maybe you shouldn't get out
and what would i do if i did
i don't know the world anymore
they say there are
bombs that can reduce whole
cities to ash
and what do they call televisions
voices and faces coming from a box
i hear enough voices already
what can you tell us about rachel
um not much she she keeps to herself
she believed her kids were alive
she thought she was still living
in the berkshire and we were all neighbours
  the milkman postmen
  deliveryman
and dr sheehan was there that night
yes um
he talked about anger
tell me about him
what's he like
i think he's uh
okay nice
not hard on the eyes
as my mother would say
did he ever make a pass at you
no
no dr sheehan is a good
doctor he would never
could i have a glass of water please
no problem
thank you marshal
i have just one more question for you
mrs kearns
did you ever meet a patient
named andrew laeddis
no
never heard of him
she was coached
she used practically the same words as
cawley and the nurse
  it's like she'd been told exactly what to say
  who is andrew laeddis
you asked every one of those patients
back there about him who is he
what the hell boss i'm your partner
for the christ sake
we just met chuck
been on the beat a long time
you got a duty got a career
and what i'm doing
not exactly by the book
i don't give a damn about by the book boss
i just to know what the hell is going on
when this case came over the wires
  i requested it specifically do you understand
  why
andrew laeddis
was the maintenance man in the apartment
building where my wife and i lived
okay
he was also a firebug
andrew laeddis lit the match
that caused the fire that killed my wife
let 'em out
what happened to laeddis
got away with it
laeddis got away with it and disappeared
about a year ago i opened up the
newspaper and there he is
he's an ugly looking son of a bitch
he had a new scar from his right temple
down to his left lip
eyes different colors
not the type of face you forget
he'd burned down a schoolhouse killed 2 people
he said voices told him to do it
first he was sent to prison
and then he was transferred here
  then what
  then nothing
he vanished like he never existed
no record whatsoever
i'm sure he's not in ward b
that leaves ward c
or he could be dead
so could rachel solando for that matter
lot of places to hide a body here
only one place
no one really knows
that patient bridget kearne
when she sent me for water
she said something to you back there didn't she
no
come on boss
she wrote it

boss
we gotta get indoors it's turning
into fucking kansas out here
  all right 
  now let's go
watch out
jesus
come on let's go back
jesus christ
damn it
  are you okay boss
  yes that's all right
so if laeddis is here
what are you going to do boss
i'm not here to kill leaddis
if it was my wife
i'd kill him twice
when we got through the gates of dakau
the ss guards surrendered
the commandante tried to kill himself
before we got there
but he botched it
took him an hour to die
when i went outside
i saw all the bodies on the ground
too many to count
too many to imagine
so yeah
the guards surrendered we took
their guns we lined them up
it wasn't warfare
it was murder 
yeah i've had enough of killing
that's not why i'm here
so what is this all about
after laeddis vanished
i started doing some checking
on ashecliffe
a lot of people knew about this place but no
one wants to talk
you know it's like they're scared of something
you know this place is funded by
a special grant
from the house of
unamerican activities committee
huac and how exactly are we fighting
the commies from an island in boston harbor
by conducting experiments on the mind
at least that's my guess
and you think thats going on in here
like i said no one would talk right
until i found someone
who used to be a patient here
guy's name is george noyce
nice college kid
socialist
he gets offered some money for some
psych study guess what they were testing
  drug tests
  so he starts seeing dragons everywhere
almost beats his proffesor to death
ends up here in ashecliffe
ward c
they released him after 1 year right
what does he do
two weeks on the mainland he walks into
a bar and stabs three men to death
his lawyer pleads insanity
but noyce
stands up in the courtroom and
he begs the judge
for the electric chair
anywhere but not a
mental hospital
judge gives him life in the dedham prison
  and you found him
  yes i found him
he's a mess
but it is pretty clear from what he tells me
they're experimenting on people here
i don't know boss
  how do you believe a crazy guy
  that's the beauty of it
crazy people are a perfect subject
they talk but nobody listens
i stood in dakau
we saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other right
for christ sake we fought a goddamn war
to stop them
and now find out it may be happening here
on our soil
no
so what are you really here to do teddy
i'm gonna get the proof
i'm gonna go back and blow
the lid off this place
that's it
wait a minute
you started asking around about ashecliffe
waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a us marshal
i got lucky there was a patient escape
it was the perfect excuse
no no no boss
luck doesn't work that way
the world doesn't work that way they got an
electrified fence around a septic facility
ward c is inside a civil war fort
a chief of staff with ties to the oss
funding from huac
jesus christ everything about this place
stinks of government ops
  what if they wanted you here
  bullshit
  you were asking questions
  bullshit
bullshit we came in for rachel solando where is
one shred of evidence that she even existed
there's no way they could of known i'd be
assigned to this case no way
while you were looking into them
they were looking into you
all they need to do
is fake an escape to get you here
and now they have you
they have us both here now
marshal are you out here
this is deputy warden mcpherson
marshal
how about that they found us huh
it's an island boss they're always gonna find us
i know you are in there
we're getting off of this goddamned island
you and me
come on
  come on
  go
get dried off
dr cawley wants to talk to you now
and hurry up this thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane
i dropped those suits off to be cleaned
it should be ready by tomorrow
that is if we don't all wash away first
speaking of which i'm afraid your smokes were
pretty much done for
so
this is our only choice huh
got something really nice in prison already
if that don't work for you
now that you mention it these are just fine
that's why i must repeat my insistence
that all ward c patients
be placed in manual restraints
if the facility floods they'll drown
you know that
  that would take a lot of flooding
  we are on an island
in the middle of the ocean
during a hurricane
a lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility
it's a gamble steven
say the power fails
there's a backup generator
and if that goes the cell doors
will open
where are they going to go
hmm
they can't just hop a ferry scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc
you're quite right they're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us
if they're manacled to the floor they'll die
that's 24 human beings
you can't live with that can you
frankly if it were up to me
i'd put all 42 in ward a and b in
manual restraints as well
excuse me
excuse me
  marshal
  i'm sorry doctor i just have one quick question
yes i will be with you in a moment
we spoke this morning
about rachel solando's note
the law of 4 i loved that
you said you had no idea what
that second line could refer to correct
who is 67
yes i'm afraid i still don't
none of us do
uh huh nothing comes to mind
nothing
because i believe i just heard
you say that there are
24 patients in ward c
and 42 of patients in wards a and b
which means there is a total of what
66 patients here in this facility
that is correct yes
then it seems that
rachel solando was suggesting
you have a 67th patient doctor
  but i'm afraid we don't
  this is ridiculous
  what are you doing here
  we are doing our goddamn job
didn't mcpherson tell you the good news
no what's the good news doctor
rachel has been found
she's here
safe and sound
there is not a mark on her
who are these men
why are they in my house
police officers rachel
they have a few questions
ma'am
there's been a sighting of a known
communist
subversive in this area
passing out literature
here
in this neighborhood
yes i'm afraid so
if you can tell us what you did
yesterday where you were
it would really help us narrow our search
yes
well iumm
i made breakfast for jim
and the children
and then i
i packed jim's lunch
and he left
then i sent the children off to school
and then
i decided to take a long swim in the lake
i see
and after that
after that
i thought of you
i i'm sorry ma'am
i don't know what you're talking about
don't you know how lonely i've been jim
you're gone
you're dead
i cry every night
how am i supposed to survive
god
rachel it will be all right
i'm so sorry but
everything is gonna be all right okay
i buried you
i buried an empty casket your body
rained down lumps of flesh splashing
into the sea eaten by sharks
my jim is dead
so who the fuck are you
who the fuck are you
who are you who are you
i'm sorry about that
i didn't want to interrupt i thought
she might tell you something but
we found her down by the lighthouse
skipping stones
we have no idea how she got out there i'm going
to ask you both to go down into basement
there's food water and cots
it's the safest place to be
when the hurricane hits
are you all right
you look pale
i'm fine it's just uh
boss are you okay
it's just so goddamn bright isn't it
photo sensitivity headaches sometimes
marshal are you having a migraine
i'll be alright
  what's wrong with him
  take these marshal you'll sleep a couple
of hours wake up clear as a bell
he's having a migraine
imagine someone sawed open your head and
filled it with razors then shook it

everything you were up to
your whole plan

in a maze
george
you're wrong
really
been alone much since
you got here
i'm been with my partner
you have never worked
with him before have you
he's a
us marshal from seattle
you have never worked
with him before have you
george look
i know people

fuck
they're going to
take me to the lighthouse
they're going to
cut into my brain
and i'm only here because of you
george i'm going to get you out of here
you're not going to the lighthouse
you can't dig out the truth and
kill laeddis at the same time
you've got to make a choice

she'll kill you she's going to kill you
you want to uncover the truth
you've gotta let her go 
  i can't
  you have to let her go
i can't
i can't
then you'll never leave
this island
dolores
he's not in this ward
he was transferred
out of here
if he's not in ward a
there's only one place he can be
the lighthouse
hey
god help you
boss we got problems
mcpherson and cawley are in the building
they heard an orderly went batshit on a patient
they're looking all over the place for him
they're on the way to the roof
let's get the hell out of here
this way
just keep going
we belong here
  what happened to you
  what do you mean
where were you
after we got that guy to the infirmary
i took a little detour
to patient records
did you ever find laeddis
no
  no i never found him
  well i've got the next best thing
his intake form
it was the only thing in his file
no session notes no incident reports
no photographs just this
it was weird
here take a look
i'll look at it later
what's the matter boss
i'll take a look at it later
that's all
ashecliffe's that way
i'm not going to ashecliffe
i'm going to the lighthouse
i'm going to find out what
the fuck is happening on this island
here it is
damn
we're too far south
we're gonna have to double back
there's no way we could cross those rocks
there could be a way behind those trees
maybe a path that goes around the rocks
that leads over to the lighthouse
what are we doing here
we've got the intake form
it proves there's a 67th patient
which they've said repeatedly doesn't exist
i'm getting to that lighthouse
do you understand
what the hell can i say to you
to stop you
why would you want to chuck
why
because climbing down there
when it's dark is a thin step short
to suicide that's why
okay
maybe you better sit this one out then
you brought me into this boss
and now i am trapped here on this rock
on this island
without no one to rely on but eachother
and now you're acting like
like what like what
how am i acting
what the hell happened back there
in those cells ted
  what do you think the weather is like in portland chuck
  i'm from seattle
seattle
i'll going onalone
i'm going with you boss
i said alone
fine
damn it
damn it
i knew it wouldn't take long
but i couldn't get to it the tide was up
chuck
chuck
come on
chuck
where are you chuck
chuck
chuck
who are you
i'm teddy daniels
i'm a cop
you're the marshal
that's right
would you mind
taking your hand from behind
your back please
why
why
i want to make sure what you're
holding won't hurt me
i'm gonna keep this
if you don't mind
fine by me
you're rachel solando
the real one
did you kill your children
i never had children
i was never married
and before i was a patient
in ashecliff i worked here
you were a nurse
i was a doctor marshal
you think i'm crazy
  no i 
  and if i say i'm not crazy 
well that hardly helps does it
that's the kafkaesque genius of it
people tell the world you're crazy
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirms what they're saying
i'm not following you
i'm sorry
once you are declared insane
then anything you do is called
a part of an insanity
your reasonable protests
or denial
valid fears
paranoia
survival instincts
defense mechanisms
you're smarter than you look marshal
that's probably not a good thing
tell me something
yeah
what happened to you
i started asking about these large
shipments of sodium anatol
  an opium based hallucinogen
  psychotropic drugs
i asked about the surgeries too
ever heard of trans orbital lobotomy
they zap the patient with electroshocks
then go through the eye with an ice pick
and pull out some nerve fibers
makes the patients much more obedient
tractable
it's barbaric
unconscionable
do you know how pain enters the
body marshal do you
depends on where you hurt
no it has nothing to do with the flesh
the brain controls pain
the brain controls fear empathy
sleep hunger anger everything
what if you could control it
the brain
re create a man
so he doesn't feel pain
or love or sympathy
a man who can't be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess
you can never take away
all a man's memories
never
marshal the north koreans
used american pows
during their brainwashing experiments
they turned soldiers into traitors
that's what they are doing here
they're creating ghosts to go out in the world
and do things sane men never do
to have that kind of ability that kind of knowledge
that would take years
years of research
hundreds of patients to experiment on
50 years from now
people will look back
and say here this place
is where it all began
the nazis used the jews
the soviets
used prisoners in their own gulags
and we
we tested patients
on shutter island
no they won't 
no
you do understand
that they can't let you leave
i am a federal marshal 
they can't stop me
i was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family
it didn't matter
let me ask you 
any past traumas in your life
yes why why would that matter
because they can point to some
event in your past and say
it is the reason you lost your sanity
so that when they commit you here
your friends and colleagues will say 
of course he cracked
and who wouldn't have
after what he'd been through
that could be said of anyone
  anyone at all
  the point is they're going to say it about you
how's your head
  my head
  any funny dreams lately
trouble sleeping headaches
i am prone to migraines yes
jesus
you haven't taken any pills have you
  i mean even aspirin
  they hit the aspirin
jesus
and you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank
coffee they gave you
you tell me at least that
you've been smoking your own cigarettes
no no
no i haven't
it takes 36 to 48 hours for
neuroleptic narcotics
to reach sufficient levels in
the blood stream
pulse becomes first
first the fingertips and then
eventually the whole hand
seen any waking nightmares lately
marshal
tell me what goes on in that lighthouse
tell me
brain surgery
let's open the skull and see
what happens if we pull on this kind
we learned it from the nazi's kind
it's where they create the ghosts
who knows about this
on the island i mean who
everyone
oh come on the nurses the orderlies
  they couldn't possibly know
  everyone
you can't stay here
they think i'm dead that i drowned i'm afraid
if they come looking for you they might find me
i'm sorry but you have to go
i'm gonna come back for you
i won't be here i move during the day
new places every night
but i could come get you
off of this island
haven't you heard a word i've said
the only way off the island
is the ferry and they control it
you'll never leave here
i had a friend
i was with him yesterday
but we got separated
have you seen him
marshal
you have no friends
there you are
we've been wondering when
you'd show up
have a seat
come on
taking a leisurely stroll were we
i was just
just looking around
did you enjoy
god's latest gift
  what
  god's gift
the violence
when i came downstairs in my home
and i saw that tree in my living room
it reached down for me like a divine hand
god loves violence
  i hadn't noticed
  sure you have
why else would there be so much of it
it's in us
it's what we are
we wage war we burn sacrifices
we pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh
of our brothers
and why because god gave us violence
to wage in his honor
i thought god gave us moral order
there is no moral order
as pure as this storm
there's no moral order at all
there's just this
can my violence conquer yours
  i'm not violent
  yes you are
you're as violent as they come
i know this because i'm as violent as they come
with the constraints of society
we are lifted and
if i was all that stood between you and a meal you
would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts
wouldn't you
cawley thinks you're harmless that you can be
controlled but i know different
  you don't know me
  oh but i do oh i know you
we've known each other for centuries
if i was to sink my teeth into your eye
right now
would you be able to stop me before i blinded you
give it a try
that's the spirit
where have you been
wandering just looking at your island
oh i forgot you're leaving
now that rachel has been found
sure yeah
big meeting
oh yes 
apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward c yesterday
he subdued a highly dangerous patient
quite handily
is that so
it seems he had a long conversation with a
paranoid schizophrenic george noyce
this noyce
you said his name was
  he's delusional
  oh extremely he can be quite upsetting
in fact two weeks ago a patient
got so wound up
by one of noyce's stories
that he beat him up
cigarette
oh no thanks
i quit
so you're taking the ferry
oh yes absolutely i uh
i think we've gotten
all we came here for so
we marshal
speaking of which have you
  seen him doctor
  who
my partner chuck
you don't have a partner marshal
you came here alone
you know i've built something valuable here
and valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time
everyone wants a quick fix
they always have
i'm trying to do something that people
yourself included don't understand
and i'm not going to give up
without a fight
i can see that
so tell me again
about your partner
what partner
marshal
going somewhere
no just heading out
to the ferry so
i'm afraid it's the other way
if you wait a moment
i'll find someone who can take you
to the dock
what is this doctor
it's just a sedative
  it's for precaution
  precaution
what are you going to do
kill me marshal
you think you deserve it
for what
for provoking you
and forgive me
what doesn't provoke you
remarks
  words
  nazis
well that too
and of course memories dreams
did you know that the word trauma comes
from the greek for wound
and what is the german word for dream
traumen
traumen
wounds can create monsters
and you 
you are wounded marshal
wouldn't you agree
when you see a monster
you must stop it
  i agree
  yes
what are you doing baby
you've got to get to the ferry
no no 
no
if the world thinks that chuck is dead
then he is perfect for their experiments
there's only one place they'd take him
you go there and you'll die
he's my partner if they are hurting him if they are
holding him against his will i've got to bring him out
i can't lose anyone else
don't go teddy
please don't do this don't go
i'm sorry honey
i love this thing because
you gave it to me
but the truth is 
it's one fucking ugly tie
no
don't move
stay where you are
are you going to kill me
no
i'm not gonna kill you
why are you all wet baby
  what did you say
  you know exactly what i said
the rifle's empty by the way
have a seat
for god's sake dry off
you're going to catch a cold
alright
how badly did you hurt the guard
i don't know what
you're talking about
yes he's here
have drsheehan take a good look
at your man before you send him up
so dr shehan
he came on the ferry
this morining
not exactly
you blew up my car
i really loved that car
sorry to hear about that
tremors are getting pretty bad
how are the hallucinations
get out of here teddy
this place is gonna be the end of you
  not bad
  they'll get worse
i know
dr solando
she told me about neuroleptics
did she now
and when was this
i found the doctor in a cave out by the cliffs
but you'll never get to her
i don't doubt it
considering she's not real
but your hallucinations are
more severe than i thought
you are not on neuroleptics
you are not on anything
as a matter of fact
then what the fuck is this
huh what the fuck is this
withdrawal
withdrawal
from what i haven't even had a goddamned
drink since i've been on this island
chlorpromazine
i'm not a fan of pharmacology
but i have to say in your case 
  clorpro what
  chlorpromazine
the same thing we've
been giving you for the past 24 months
so for the past two years
you've had somebody slipping
me drugs in boston is that it
not boston
here
you've been here for two years
a patient of this institution
after everything i seen here doctor
you really think you're gonna
convince me i'm crazy huh
do you know the kind of people i deal with everyday
i'm a us marshal for gods sake
you were a us marshal
here's a copy of the intake form
you broke into ward c for
proof of the 67th patient
if you'd gotten it to the mainland
you could have blown the lid off this place
  wait wait
  but somehow
you couldn't find time
to look at it well read it now
go ahead
the patient is highly intelligent
highly delusional
decorated army veteran
present for the
liberation of dakau
former us marshal
known proclivity for violence
shows no remorse for his crime because
he denies 
that the crime ever took place
highly developed and fantastical
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions
i've had enough of this bullshit
where's my partner huh
where's chuck
where is he
let's try this another way
your wife's maiden name was
chanal am i correct
  don't you even talk about her
  i'm afraid i have to
notice anything these four names have in common
your rule of 4
  andrew what do you see
  if you have done anything
  to my partner doctor that is a violation 
  focus andrew what do you see
the names 
have the same letters
edward daniels has exactly the same
13 letters
as andrew laeddis
the same as rachel solando
and dolores chanal the names
  are anagrams for each other
  your tactics they're not going to
work on me
you came here for the truth
here it is
your name is andrew laeddis
the 67th patient at ashecliffe
is you andrew
bullshit
you were committed here by
court order 24 months ago
your crime is terrible
one you can't forgive yourself for
so you invented
another self
let's get down to the facts
you've created a story in which
you're not a murderer you are hero
still a us marshal
only here at ashecliffe
because of a case
and you've uncovered a conspiracy
so that anything we tell you about
who you are what you've done
you can dismiss as lies andrew
my name is edward daniels
i've been hearing this fantasy
for two years now i know every detail
patient 67 the storm
rachel solando
your missing partner
the dreams you have every night
you were at dakau
but you may not have killed any guards
i wish i could let you just
live in your fantasy world
i really do
but you're violent trained dangerous
you're the most dangerous patient we have
you've injured orderlies guards
other patients
two weeks ago
you attacked george noyce
no no i am fucking on to you doctor
  you had noyce beaten
  of course i didn't
give me one reason
why i would even touch him
because he called you laeddis
and you do anything not to be him
i have a transcript of that conversation
you had with noyce yesterday
this is about you and laeddis
that's all it's ever been about
no no he is saying that it's about
me and laeddis
when you've asked him what happened
to his face
said and i quote again
you did this
  no he meant it was my fault he
  you almost killed him
the warden and the board of overseers
are determined something be done it's been decided
that unless we can bring you back into sanity now
right now
permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you can't hurt anyone ever again
they'll lobotomize you andrew
do you understand
yes i understand
i understand just fine
if if i don't play along
with your little game here
dr naehring is gonna turn me into
one of his ghosts
what about my partner
you're gonna tell the us marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism
hello boss
what the fuck is going on here
you working for him
i'm sorry about that
someone had to stick with you keep you safe
you've been watching me huh
watching me every minute
who who are you
who are you
tell me
don't you recognize me andrew
i've been you primary psychiatrist
for the last two years
i am lester sheehan
and i told you about my wife 
  i know
  i climbed down a cliff to get you
i trusted you i risked
everything to come in here after you everything
i know boss
we're running out of time here andrew
i swore before the entire board of
overseers that i could construct
the most radical cutting edge role play
ever attempted in psychiatry and
it would bring you back
i thought if we let you play
this out
we could get you to see how
untrue how impossible it is
we've had to run of the place for two days
tell me where are the nazi experiments
the satanic or's
andrew listen to me
if we fail with you
then everything we've tried
to do here will be discredited
everything
we are on the front line of a war here old boy
and right now it'll come down to you
don't move don't move
  andrew no
  my name is edward daniels
this one is loaded
i can tell by the weight
i see and that's your firearm marshal
you're sure
my initials are on the side and there's a dent in the 
barrel from when philip stacks shot at me 
you're not going to fuck with my mind on this
one doc
then blast away because that's the
only way you're ever getting off this island
andrew please don't
my gun
what have you done to
my goddamn gun
it's a toy andrew
we're telling you the truth
dolores was insane manic depressive
suicidal
you drank stayed away
ignored what everyone had told you
you moved to that lake house after
she purposely
set your city apartment on fire
andrew andrew
stop it
you're lying
andrew your children
simon
  henry
  i didn't have any children
your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake
and here the little girl
the one you dream of
every night
i never had a little
the one who tells you over and over that
you should have saved her
saved them all
your daughter
her name was rachel are you going to deny
that she ever lived
andrew are you
i'm so sorry baby
i told you not to come in here
i told you
this would be the end of you
i'm back
we got him
just outside of oklahoma
must of stopped ten places
in between here and tulsa
i could sleep for a week
dolores
dolores
dolores
dolores
baby
why are you all wet
i missed you
i want to go home
you are home
where are the kids
they're in school
it's saturday honey
school's not in on saturday
my school is
oh my god
my god
god
oh my god no
come on
come on
please god no
no
no
no
no
let's put them in the room
we'll dry them off
we'll change their clothes
they'll be our living dolls
tomorrow we can take them on a picnic
if you ever loved me dolores
please stop talking
i love you
set me free
honey
we'll give them baths
  i love you so much dolores
  and i love you i love you
andrew
andrew can you hear me
rachel
rachel rachel
rachel
rachel who
rachel laeddis
my daughter
why are you here
because i killed my wife
and why did you do that
dhe murdered our children
and she told me to let her go
  who is teddy daniels
  he doesn't exist
neither does rachel solando
i made them up
why
we need to hear you say it
after she tried to kill
herself the first time
dolores told me she
she had an insect
living inside her brain
she could feel it
clicking across
her skull
pulling the wires
just for fun
she told me that
she told me but i didn't listen
i loved her so much
why did you make them up
because i can't take knowing
that dolores killed our children
i killed them because
i didn't get her help
i killed them
here's my theory andrew
we broke through once before
nine months ago
and then you regressed
  i don't remember that
  i know
you reset andrew
like a tape
playing over and over on an endless loop
i hope that what we've done will be enough
to stop it from ever happening again
but i need to know 
you have accepted the reality
you came after me huh doctor
you tried to help me when no one else would
my name is andrew laeddis
and i murdered my wife
in the spring of '52
how we doing this morning
good
and you
can't complain
so what's our next move
you tell me
i've gotta get off this rock
chuck
get back to the mainland whatever the
hell is going on here it's bad
don't worry partner
they're not gonna catch us
that's right we're too smart for them
yeah we are
aren't we
you know this place makes
me wonder
yeah what's that boss
which would be worse
to live as a monster 
or to die as a good man
teddy
