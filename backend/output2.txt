forget it it's too risky
i'm through doing that shit
you always say that
the same thing every time
i'm through never again
too dangerous
i know that's what i always say
i'm always right too
but you forget about it
in a day or two
well the days of me
forgetting are over
and the days of me remembering
have just begun
you know when you go on
like this what you sound like
i sound like
a sensible fucking man
you sound like a duck
quack quack quack
take heart 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again
since i'm never
gonna do it again
you're never gonna
have to hear me quack
about how i'm never
gonna do it again
after tonight
correct
i got all tonight to quack
can i get anyone more coffee
oh yes thank you
you're welcome
i mean the way it is now
you're taking the same risk
as when you rob a bank
you take more of a risk
banks are easier
federal banks
ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery
they're insured
why should they give a fuck
you don't even need a gun
in a federal bank
i heard about
this one bloke
he walks into a bank
with a portable phone
he gives the phone
to the teller
bloke on the other end
of the phone says
we got this guy's little girl
if you don't give him
all your money
  we're gonna kill her
  did it work
fucking way it works
that's what i'm talking about
knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone
not a pistol not a shotgun
a fucking phone
cleans the place out
they don't even lift
a fucking finger
did they hurt the little girl
i don't know probably never was
a girl in the first place
the point isn't the girl
the point is
they robbed a bank
with a telephone
you want to rob banks
i'm not saying
i want to rob banks
if we did it would be easier
than what we been doing
no more liquor stores
what we been talking about
yeah no more liquor stores
besides it ain't the giggle
it used to be
there's too many foreigners
own liquor stores
vietnamese koreans they don't
even speak fucking english
you tell 'em
empty out the register
they don't know what the fuck
you're talking about
they make it too personal
we keep on one of these gook
fucker's gonna make us kill him
i'm not gonna kill anybody
i don't want to kill anybody
either
but they'll probably
put us in a situation
where it's us or them
and if it's not the gooks
it's these old fucking jews
who've owned the store
for fifteen fucking generations
you got grandpa irving
sitting behind the counter
with a fucking magnum
in his hand
try walking into one of those
places with nothing but a phone
see how far that gets you
fuck it we're out of it
yeah well what then
day jobs
  not in this life
  what then
garçon coffee
this place
garçon means boy
this place a coffee shop
what's wrong with that
nobody ever robs restaurants
why not
bars liquor stores
gas stations
you get your head blown off
sticking up one of them
restaurants on the other hand
you catch with their pants down
they're not expecting
to get robbed
not as expecting anyway
i bet you could
cut down on the hero factor
in a place like this
correct
same as banks
these places are insured
manager he don't give a fuck
he's just trying
to get you out the door
before you start
plugging the diners
waitresses fucking forget it
no way they're taking a bullet
for the register
busboys some wetback
getting paid $150 an hour
really give a fuck
you're stealing from the owner
customers sitting
with food in their mouths
they don't know
what's going on
one minute they're
having a denver omelet
next minute someone's
sticking a gun in their face
see i got the idea
last liquor store we stuck up
remember
all the customers
kept coming in
yeah
you got the idea
taking their wallets
mm hmm
  now that was a good idea
thank you
made more from the wallets
than we did from the register
yes we did
  people come to restaurants
a lot of wallets
pretty smart huh
pretty smart
i'm ready let's do it
right now right here
come on
  all right
same as last time remember
you're crowd control
i handle employees
i love you pumpkin
i love you honey bunny
everybody be cool
this is a robbery
any of you
fucking pricks move
and i'll execute every
motherfucking last one of you
ha ha ha
jungle boogie
jungle boogie
  get it on
  jungle boogie
  jungle boogie
  get it on
  jungle boogie
  get up with the boogie
  jungle boogie
  get up with the get down
  jungle boogie
  get down with the boogie
  jungle boogie
  come and shake it around
ok so tell me again
about the hash bars
  ok what you want to know
  hash is legal there right
yeah it's legal
but it ain't 100% legal
you just can't walk
into a restaurant
roll a joint
and start puffing away
i mean they want you to smoke
in your home
  or certain designated places
  and those are hash bars
yeah it breaks down like this
it's legal to buy it
it's legal to own it
and if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar
it's legal to sell it
it's legal to carry it
but but that doesn't matter
'cause get a load of this
all right
if you get stopped by a cop
in amsterdam
it's illegal
for them to search you
i mean that's a right the cops
in amsterdam don't have
oh man i'm going
that's all there is to it
i'm fucking going
i know baby
you'd dig it the most
but you know what the funniest
thing about europe is
  what
  it's the little differences
i mean they got the same shit
over there that they got here
but it's just
a little different
example
you can go to a movie theater
in amsterdam and buy a beer
and i don't mean just like
in no paper cup
i'm talking about
a glass of beer
and in paris you can
buy a beer at mcdonald's
and you know what they call
a quarter pounder with cheese
in paris
they don't call it
a quarter pounder with cheese
no man they got
the metric system there
they wouldn't know what the fuck
a quarter pounder is
what do they call it
they call it
a royale with cheese
  royale with cheese
that's right
what do they call a big mac
big mac's a big mac
but they call it le big mac
le big mac ha ha ha ha
what do they call a whopper
i don't know
i didn't go into burger king
you know what they put on
french fries in holland
  instead of ketchup
  what
  mayonnaise
  goddamn
ha ha ha
i've seen 'em do it man
they fucking drown 'em
in that shit
yuck
we should have shotguns
for this kind of deal
  how many up there
  three or four
that's counting our guy
i'm not sure
so that means it could be
up to five guys up there
it's possible
we should have fucking shotguns
what's her name
mia
mia how did marsellus
and her meet
i don't know
however people meet people
she used to be an actress
oh really she do anything
i'd have seen
i think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot
pilot what's a pilot
well you know the shows on tv
i don't watch tv
yeah but you are aware
that there's an invention
called television
and on this invention
they show shows right
yeah
the way they pick tv shows
they make one show
that show's called a pilot
then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows
and on the strength
of that one show
they decide if they want
to make more shows
some get chosen
and become television programs
some don't become nothing
she starred in one of the ones
that became nothing
you remember antwan rockamora
half black half samoan
used to call him
tony rocky horror
yeah maybe fat right
i wouldn't go so far
as to call the brother fat
i mean he got a weight problem
what's the nigger gonna do
he's samoan
yeah i think i know
who you mean what about him
well
marsellus fucked him up good
word around the campfire is
it was on account
of marsellus wallace's wife
so what'd he do fuck her
no no no no no
nothing that bad
well then what then
gave her a foot massage
  a foot massage that's it
  mm hmm
then what did marsellus do
sent a couple of cats
over to his place
they took him out on his patio
threw his ass over the balcony
nigger fell four stories
they had a little garden
down at the bottom
enclosed in glass
like a greenhouse
nigger fell through that
since then he kind of
developed a speech impediment
that's a damn shame
but still i have to say
you play with matches
you get burned
what do you mean
you don't be giving
marsellus wallace's new bride
a foot massage
you don't think he overreacted
well antwan probably
didn't expect marsellus
to react the way he did
but he had to expect a reaction
it was a foot massage
a foot massage is nothing
i give my mother a foot massage
no it's laying hands
in a familiar way
on marsellus' new wife
i mean is it as bad
as eating her pussy out
no but it's
the same fucking ballpark
whoa whoa whoa
stop right there
eating a bitch out and giving
a bitch a foot massage
ain't even
the same fucking thing
it's not
it's the same ballpark
ain't no fucking ballpark
neither
now look maybe your method
of massage differs from mine
but you know
touching his wife's feet
and sticking your tongue
in her holiest of holies
ain't the same fucking ballpark
it ain't the same league
it ain't even
the same fucking sport
look
foot massages don't mean shit
have you ever given
a foot massage
don't be telling me
about foot massages
i'm the foot fucking master
  you given a lot of 'em
  shit yeah
got my technique down
and everything
i don't be tickling or nothing
would you give a guy
a foot massage
fuck you
  you given 'em a lot
  fuck you
you know i'm kind of tired
i could use
a foot massage myself
yo yo yo man
you best back off
i'm getting
a little pissed here
  this is the door
  there it is
what time you got
722 in the am
no it ain't quite time yet
come on let's hang back
just 'cause i wouldn't give
no man a foot massage
don't make it right
for marsellus
to throw antwan
off a building
into a glass
motherfucking house
fucking up the way the nigger
talks that shit ain't right
motherfucker do that shit to me
he better paralyze my ass
'cause i'd kill
the motherfucker
  you know what i'm saying
  i ain't saying it's right
but you're saying a foot massage
don't mean nothing
and i'm saying it does
i've given a million ladies
a million foot massages
and they all meant something
now we act like they don't
but they do
that's what's so fucking cool
about 'em
there's a sensuous thing
going on where you know
you don't talk about it but you
know it and she knows it
fucking marsellus knew it
and antwan should've fucking
better known better
i mean
that's his fucking wife man
this ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit
you know what i'm saying
it's an interesting point
come on
let's get into character
what's her name again
  mia
  mia
why you so interested
in big man's wife
well he's going out of town
florida
and he asked me if i'd take care
of her while he's gone
  take care of her
  no man just take her out
you know show her a good time
make sure she don't get lonely
you're gonna be taking
mia wallace out on a date
it is not a date
it's just like if you were going
to take your buddy's wife
to a movie or something
it's just good company
that's all
it's not a date
it's definitely not a date
hey kids how you boys doing

well there's this
passage i got memorized
sort of fits this occasion
ezekiel 2517
the path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides
by the inequities
of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will
shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness
for he is truly
his brother's keeper
and the finder
of lost children
and i will strike down
upon thee
with great vengeance
and furious anger
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers
and you will know
my name is the lord
when i lay my vengeance
upon thee
no
let's stay together
i think you're gonna find
when all this shit
is over and done
i think
you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker
thing is butch
right now you got ability
but painful as it may be
ability don't last
and your days
are just about over
now that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life
but that's a fact of life
your ass is gonna have
to get realistic about
see this business
is filled to the brim
with unrealistic
motherfuckers
motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine
if you mean it turns
to vinegar it does
if you mean it gets better
with age it don't
besides butch
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway
hmm two
boxers don't have
an old timer's day
you came close
but you never made it
and if you were
gonna make it
you would have made it
before now
good or bad
or happy or sad
ooh ooh ooh

it certainly appears so
night of the fight
you may feel a slight sting
that's pride fucking with you

according to the show
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife
and she knew
a zillion old jokes
her grandfather
an old vaudevillian taught her
and if we would've
got picked up
they would've worked in
a gimmick where every show
i would've told another joke
you know any of them old jokes
well i only got the chance
to say one
'cause we only did one show
  tell me
  it's corny
don't be that way
tell me
no you wouldn't like it
and i'd be embarrassed
you'd be em
you told 50 million people
and you can't tell me
i promise i won't laugh
that's what i'm afraid of
vince
that's not what i meant
and you know it
well now i'm definitely
not gonna tell you
'cause it's been
built up too much
what a gyp
martin and lewis
vanilla coke
mmm yummy
you think
i could have a sip of that
be my guest
i gotta know what a $500 shake
tastes like
you can use my straw
i don't have cooties
  yeah but maybe i do
  cooties i can handle
all right
goddamn that's a pretty
fuckin' good milk shake
told you
i don't know
if it was worth $500
but it was pretty fucking good
don't you hate that
hate what
uncomfortable silences
why do we feel
it's necessary
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable
i don't know
but it's a good question
that's when you know you've
found somebody really special
when you can just
shut the fuck up for a minute
and comfortably share a silence
well i don't think
we're quite there yet
but don't feel bad
we just met each other
i'll tell you what
i'm going to go to the bathroom
and powder my nose
you sit here
and think of something to say
i'll do that
ok
i said goddamn goddamn
goddamn
i need some hair spray
mmm don't you just love it
when you come back
from the bathroom
to find your food
waiting for you
we're lucky
we got anything at all
i don't think buddy holly's
much of a waiter
maybe we should've sat
in marilyn monroe's section
would you like some coffee
which one there's two monroes
no there's not
that is marilyn monroe
that is mamie van doren
and i don't see
jayne mansfield
she must have the night off
or somethin'
  pretty smart
  yeah i got my moments
so did you think
of somethin' to say
actually i did
however
you seem like
a really nice person
and i don't want to offend you
ooh this doesn't sound like
the usual mindless boring
gettin' to know you chitchat
that sounds like you actually
have somethin' to say
well well i do
i do
but you have to promise
not to be offended
no no no no
you can't promise
somethin' like that
i have no idea
what you're gonna ask me
so you can go ahead and ask me
what you're gonna ask me
and my natural response
could be to get offended
then
through no fault of my own
  i would've broken my promise
  let's just forget it
that's an impossibility
trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this
would be an exercise
in futility
is that a fact
besides
isn't it more exciting
  when you don't have permission
all right all right
well here it goes
what did you uh think about
what happened to antwan
who's antwan
tony rocky horror you know him
he fell out of a window
mmm mmm
well that is one way to say it
another way to say it
would be that he was thrown out
another way would be was he was
thrown out by marsellus
and yet even another way
is to say
he was thrown of a window
by marsellus because of you
is that a fact
no no it's not a fact
it's just what i heard
  it's just what i heard
  who told you
they
they talk a lot don't they
they certainly do
they certainly do
don't be shy vincent
what else did they say
well i'm not i'm not shy
um
did it involve the f word
no no no no
they just said that antwan
had given you a foot massage
  and
  and and nothin' that's it
you heard marsellus
threw tony rocky horror
out of a four story window
for giving me a foot massage
mm hmm
  and you believe that
well i mean
at the time i was told
it sounded reasonable
marsellus throwing tony
out of a four story window
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable
no it seemed excessive
but that doesn't mean it didn't
happen i mean i understand
that marsellus is very
very protective of you
a husband being protective
of his wife is one thing
a husband
almost killing another man
for touching his wife's feet
is something else
but did it happen
only thing antwan
ever touched of mine
was my hand when he shook it
at my wedding
really
truth is
nobody knows why marsellus
threw tony out of
that four story window
except marsellus and tony
but when you little scamps
get together
you're worse
than a sewing circle
ladies and gentlemen
now the moment
you've all been waiting for
the world famous jack rabbit
slim's twist contest
this is where
one lucky couple
will win this handsome trophy
that marilyn here is holding
now who'll be
our first contestants
right here
hey all right
  i wanna dance
no no no no no no no
no no no no no no

my husband your boss
told you to take me out
and do whatever i wanted
now i want to dance
i want to win
i want that trophy
so dance good
all right you asked for it
let's hear it
for our first contestants
let's meet our first
contestants here this evening
young lady what is your name
mrs mia wallace
and how about your fella here
vincent vega
all right let's see
what you can do take it away
yay
go for it
all right
it was a teenage wedding
and the old folks
wished 'em well
you could see that pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle
and now the young
monsieur and madame
have rung the chapel bell
c'est la vie
say the old folks
it goes to show
you never can tell
they furnished off
an apartment
with a two room roebuck sale
the coolerator was crammed
with tv dinners and ginger ale
but when pierre found work
the little money comin'
worked out well
c'est la vie
say the old folks
it goes to show
you never can tell
they had a hi fi phono
boy did they let it blast
700 little records
all rock rhythm and jazz
but when the sun went down
the rapid tempo
of the music fell
c'est la vie
say the old folks
it goes to show
you never can tell
they had a teenage wedding
and the old folks
wished 'em well
you could see that pierre
did truly love
the mademoiselle

what's your thoughts on on
on how to handle this
what's yours
well i'm of the opinion
that if marsellus
lived his whole life
he don't need to know nothin'
about this incident
if marsellus knew
about this incident
i'd be in as much trouble
as you
i seriously doubt that
i can keep a secret if you can
shake on it
mum's the word
cool
now if you'll excuse me
i'm gonna go home
and have a heart attack
vincent
do you want to hear
my fox force five joke

butch
butch
stop watching tv a second
yeah
we got a special visitor
now do you
remember when i told you
your daddy died
in a pow camp
well this here
is captain koons
he was in the pow camp
with daddy
hello little man
boy i sure heard
a bunch about you
see i was a good friend
of your dad's
we were in that hanoi
pit of hell together
over five years
hopefully
you'll never have to experience
this yourself
but when two men
are in a situation
like me and your dad were
for as long as we were
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other
if it had been me who'd
not made it
major coolidge would be talkin'
right now to my son jim
but the way
it turned out
i'm talkin' to you
butch
i got somethin' for ya
this watch i got here
was first purchased
by your great grandfather
during the first world war
it was bought
in a little general store
in knoxville tennessee
made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches
up till then people just
carried pocket watches
it was bought by private
doughboy erine coolidge
on the day he set sail
for paris
this was your great 
grandfather's war watch
and he wore it every day
he was in that war
and when he'd done his duty
he went home
to your great grandmother
took the watch off
put it in an old coffee can
and in that can it stayed
till your granddad
dane coolidge
was called upon
by his country
to go overseas and fight
the germans once again
this time they called it
world war ii
your great grandfather
gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck
unfortunately dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's
dane was a marine
and he was killed
along with all the other marines
at the battle of wake island
your granddad was facing death
he knew it
none of those boys
had any illusions
about ever leaving
that island alive
so three days before
the japanese took the island
your granddad asked a gunner
on an air force transport
name of winocki
a man he had never met
before in his life
to deliver to his infant son
who he had never seen
in the flesh
his gold watch
three days later
your granddad was dead
but winocki kept his word
after the war was over
he paid a visit
to your grandmother
delivering
to your infant father
his dad's gold watch
this watch
this watch
was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down
over hanoi
he was captured
put in a vietnamese prison camp
he knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch
they'd confiscate it
take it away
the way your dad looked at it
this watch was your birthright
he'd be damned if any slopes
put their greasy yellow hands
on his boy's birthright
so he hid it
in one place he knew he could
hide somethin' his ass
five long years he wore
this watch up his ass
then he died of dysentery
he give me the watch
i hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass two years
then after seven years
i was sent home to my family
and
now
little man
i give the watch to you
it's time butch
weighing 210 pounds
floyd ray wilson
it's official
it's official wilson is dead
dan
that had to be the bloodiest
and the most brutal fight
this city has ever seen
coolidge left faster than i've
ever seen a victorious boxer
leave the ring
do you think he knew
wilson was dead
my guess would be yes richard
i could see
the frenzy in his eyes
give way to the realization
of what he was doing
i think any man would have
left the ring that fast
do you feel this tragedy
is gonna have an effect
on the world of boxing
such a tragedy can't help
but shake the boxing world
to its very foundations
but par amount importance is
during the sad weeks ahead
the eyes of the wba remain
mia
marsellus
i didn't do it man
how you doin'
great
i never thanked you for dinner
what you got
he booked
his trainer
says he don't know nothin'
i believe him
think butch surprised
his ass same as us
no we don't wanna think
we wanna know
take him to the kennel
sic the dogs on his ass
we'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't
butch's search
how do you want it done
i'm prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker
if butch goes to indochina
i want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice
ready to pop a cap
in his ass

which he never shoulda done

slightly toasted mexicans
bonsoir
esmarelda villalobos
buenas noches butch
keep the light off
is that better
sugar pop
oui
hard day at the office
pretty hard
i got in a fight
poor baby
can we make spoons
you know what i was thinkin'
about takin' a shower
i'm stinkin' like a dog
over here
mmm i like the way you stink
let me take this jacket off
i was looking at myself
in the mirror
uh huh
i wish i had a pot
you were lookin' at yourself
in the mirror
and you wish you had some pot
a pot
a pot belly
pot bellies are sexy
well you should be happy
'cause you have one
shut up fatso
i don't have a pot
i have a bit of a tummy
like madonna
when she did lucky star
it's not the same thing
i didn't know
there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy
the difference is huge
would you like it
if i had a pot belly
no pot bellies make a man
look either oafish
or like a gorilla
but on a woman
a pot belly is very sexy
the rest of you is normal
normal face normal legs
normal hips normal ass
but with a big perfectly
round pot belly
if i had one i'd wear a t shirt
two sizes too small
to accentuate it
you think men
would find that attractive
i don't give a damn
what men find attractive
it's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch
and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same
if you had a pot belly
i would punch you in it
  you'd punch me in my belly
  right in the belly
ah i'd smother you
i'd drop it right on your face
till you couldn't breathe
you'd do that
yes yes
did you get everything
yes i did
good job sugar pop
did everything go as planned
you didn't listen to the ow
you didn't listen to the radio
i never listen to your fights
were you the winner
i won all right
are you still retiring

so it all worked out
in the finish
we're not at the finish yet
baby
mmm
we're in a lot of danger
aren't we
if they find us
they'll kill us won't they
but they won't find us
will they
do you still want me
to go with you
i don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance it's
say it

well i'm not sure yet
wherever you want
we're gonna get
a lot of money from this

that we can live like hogs
in the fat house forever
i was thinkin' maybe
we could go down
someplace
in the south pacific
the kinda money
we're gonna have
is gonna carry us
a long way down there
if we wanted
we could live in bora bora
you betcha
and if after a while
you didn't dig that
go someplace else
maybe tahiti mexico
but i do not speak spanish
well you do not speak
bora boran either
besides mexican is easy

well there's
this passage i got memorized
it sort of fits the occasion
ezekiel 25 17
the path of
the righteous man
is beset on all sides
by the inequities
of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he
who in the name
of charity and good will
shepherds the weak
through
the valley of darkness
for he is truly
his brother's keeper
and the finder
of lost children
and i will strike down
upon thee
with great vengeance
and furious anger
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers
and you will know
my name is the lord
when i lay my vengeance
upon thee
uhh
aah
i'm fucked i'm fucked

with a goddamn hand cannon
you see the size
of that gun he fired at us
it was bigger than him
we should be fucking dead man
i know we was lucky
no no no no
that shit wasn't luck
yeah maybe
this was divine intervention
you know what
divine intervention is
i think so
that means that god
came down from heaven
and stopped the bullets
that's right
that's exactly what it means
god came down from heaven
and stopped
these motherfucking bullets
i think it's time for us
to leave jules
don't do that don't
fucking blow this shit off
what just happened here
was a fucking miracle
chill jules
this shit happens
wrong wrong
this shit doesn't just happen
do you want to continue
this theological discussion
in a car or in a jailhouse
with the cops
we should be fucking dead

was a miracle
and i want you to fucking
acknowledge it
all right it was a miracle

i mean you know
it's freaky but it happens
you want to play blind man

well look at
this fucking mess man
we're on a city street
in broad daylight
i can't believe it man

cops tend to notice shit
like you're driving a car
drenched in fucking blood
just take it
to a friendly place that's all
this is the valley vincent
marsellus ain't got
no friendly places
jules this ain't
my fucking town man
  shit
  what you doing
i'm calling my partner
in toluca lake
where's toluca lake
it's just over the hill here
over by burbank studios
if jimmie's ass ain't home
i don't know what the fuck
we going to do man
'cause i ain't got
no other partners in 818
jimmie yo
how you doing man
it's jules
just listen up man
me and my homeboy are in
some serious fucking shit man
we're in a car and we got
to get off the road pronto
i need to use your garage
for a couple hours
we got to be
real fucking delicate
with this jimmie situation
he's one remark away from
kicking our asses out the door
if he does what do we do
we ain't leaving
till we made a couple calls
but i don't want it
to reach that pitch
jimmie's a friend
you don't come
into your friend's house
and start telling him
what's what
just tell him not
to be abusive that's all
he kind of freaked out
back there when he saw marvin
well put yourself
in his position
it's 800 in the morning
he just woke up
he wasn't expecting this shit
shit we got to remember here
who's doing who a favor
if that favor means
that i got to take shit
then he can stick that favor
straight up his ass
nigger what the fuck
did you just do to his towel
i was drying my hands
you're supposed
to wash them first
you watched me wash them
i watched you get them wet
i was washing them
this shit's hard to get off
maybe if he had lava
i could've done a better job
i used the same
fucking soap you did
and the towel didn't look like
no goddamn maxipad
what if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this
it's shit like this
that'll bring this situation
to a head man
look
i ain't threatening you
with nothing all right
you know i respect you
and all
but just don't put me
in this position all right
all right fine fine
ask me nice like that
no problem
just go handle your friend
go ahead i don't care
mmm goddamn jimmie
this is some
serious gourmet shit
me and vincent
would've been satisfied
with some freeze dried
taster's choice right
heh and he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us
what flavor is this
knock it off julie
what
i don't need you to tell me
how fucking good my coffee is
i'm the one who buys it
i know how good it is
when bonnie goes shopping
she buys shit
i buy the gourmet
expensive stuff
because when i drink it
i want to taste it
but you know what's
on my mind right now
it ain't the coffee
in my kitchen
it's the dead nigger
in my garage
oh jimmie
don't even worry about it
i don't think about anything
i want to ask you a question
when you came pulling in here
did you notice a sign
out in the front of my house
that said
dead nigger storage
jimmie you know
i didn't see no shit
did you notice a sign
in the front of my house
that said
dead nigger storage
no i didn't
you know why
you didn't see that sign
why
'cause it ain't there
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fucking business
jimmie we're not going
to store the motherfucker
don't you fucking realize man
that if bonnie comes home
and finds a body in her house
i'm going to get divorced
no marriage counselor
no trial separation
i'm going to get
fucking divorced ok
and i don't want
to get fucking divorced
now man you know fuck
i want to help you
but i don't want to lose
my wife doing it all right
jimmie she ain't
going to leave you
don't fucking jimmie me
jules
ok
don't fucking jimmie me
there's nothing you're gonna say
that's gonna make me forget
that i love my wife is there
look you know
she comes home from work
in about an hour and a half
graveyard shift
at the hospital
you got to make
some phone calls
you got to call some people
well then do it and get
the fuck out of my house
before she gets here
that's kool and the gang
we don't want
to fuck your shit up
i want to call my people
get them to bring us in
you're fucking my shit up
right now
you'll fuck my shit up big time
if bonnie comes home
so just do me that favor
all right
the phone is in my bedroom
i suggest you get going
well say she comes home
what do you think she'll do
oh no fucking shit
she'll freak
that ain't no kind of answer
i mean you know i don't
how much
a lot or a little
you got to appreciate
what an explosive element
this bonnie situation is
i mean if she comes
home from a hard day's work
and finds a bunch
of gangsters in her kitchen
doing a bunch
of gangster shit
there ain't no telling
what she's liable to do
yeah i've grasped that jules
all i'm doing
is contemplating the ifs
i don't want to hear about
no motherfucking ifs
all i want to hear
from your ass is
you ain't got no problem
i'm on the motherfucker
go back in there
chill them niggers out
and wait for the cavalry
which will be coming directly
you ain't
got no problem jules
i'm on the motherfucker
go back in there
and chill them niggers out
and wait for the wolf
who should be coming directly
you're sending the wolf
oh you feel better
motherfucker
shit negro
that's all you had to say
is she the hysterical type
when is she due
mm hmm
give me the principals'
names again
jules
mm hmm
vincent
jimmie
bonnie
mm hmm
it's thirty minutes away
i'll be there in ten
you're jimmie right
this is your house
sure is
i'm winston wolf
i solve problems
good we got one
so i heard may i come in
yeah please do
you must be jules
which would make you vincent
let's get down
to brass tacks gentlemen
if i was informed correctly
the clock is ticking
is that right jimmie
100%
your wife bonnie
comes home at 930 in the am
is that correct
uh huh
i was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here
she wouldn't appreciate it
none too much
she wouldn't at that
that gives us forty minutes
to get the fuck out of dodge
which if you do what i say
when i say it should be plenty
now you got a corpse
in a car
minus a head in a garage
take me to it
  jimmie
  uh huh
do me a favor will you
i thought i smelled
some coffee back there
would you make me a cup
yeah sure
oh how do you take it
lots of cream
lots of sugar
about the car is there
anything i need to know
does it stall smoke
make a lot of noise
is there gas in it
anything
aside from how it looks
the car is cool
positive don't get me
out there on the road
i find out
the brake lights don't work
man far as i know
the motherfucker's tiptop
good enough
let's go back to the kitchen
here you go mr wolf
thank you jimmie
mmm
ok first thing
you two take the body
stick it in the trunk
now jimmie this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house
that would lead me to believe
that in the gar age
or under the sink you got
a bunch of cleaners and shit
yeah mr wolf
under the sink
good what i need
you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car
i'm talking fast fast fast
go in the back seat
scoop up all those little
pieces of brain and skull
get it out of there
wipe down the upholstery
now it don't need
to be spick and span
you don't need to eat off it
just give it a good once over
what you need to take care of
are the really messy parts
the pools of blood
that have collected
you got to soak that shit up
now jimmie we need to r aid
your linen closet
i need blankets
i need comforters
i need quilts
i need bedspreads
the thicker the better
the darker the better
no whites can't use 'em
we need to camouflage
the interior of the car
we're going to line
the front seat and back seat
and the floorboards
with quilts and blankets
so if a cop stops us and sticks
his big snout in the car
the subterfuge won't last
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal
jimmie lead the way
boys get to work
please would be nice
come again
i said
a please would be nice
get it straight buster
i'm not here to say please
i'm here to tell you what to do
and if self preservation
is an instinct you possess
you better fucking do it
and do it quick
i'm here to help
if my help is not appreciated
lots of luck gentlemen
no mr wolf
it ain't like that
your help is definitely
appreciated
mr wolf listen
i don't mean disrespect ok
i respect you
i don't like people barking
orders at me that's all
if i'm curt with you
it's because time is a factor
i think fast i talk fast
and i need you guys to act fast
if you want out of this
so pretty please
with sugar on top
clean the fucking car
don't be looking at me
like that all right
i can feel your look
it's a 1974 chevy nova
green
nothing except
for the mess inside
mmm about twenty minutes
nobody who'll be missed
you're a good man joe

shows character
i have character
because you are a character
doesn't mean
that you have character
want to share a cab
i could go for some breakfast
feel like having breakfast
with me
cool
i don't know why
i thought he'd be european
yo man he's about as european
as english bob
i know that now but
  was he cool or what
  thank you
totally fucking cool
in control
didn't even really get pissed
when you were fucking with him
i was amazed
want some bacon
no man i don't eat pork
are you jewish
naw i ain't jewish
i just don't dig on swine
that's all
why not
pigs are filthy animals
i don't eat filthy animals
yeah but bacon tastes good
pork chops taste good
hey a sewer rat
may taste like pumpkin pie
but i'd never know
'cause i wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers
pigs sleep and root in shit
that's a filthy animal
i ain't eating nothing
that ain't got sense enough
to disregard its own feces
how about a dog
a dog eats his own feces
i don't eat dog either
but do you consider a dog
to be a filthy animal
i wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy
but they're definitely dirty
but a dog's got personality
personality goes a long way
ah so by that rationale
if a pig had
a better personality
he would cease to be
a filthy animal
is that true
we'd have to be talking about
one charming motherfucking pig
he'd have to be ten times
more charming
than arnold on green acres
you know what i'm saying
oh man that's good
that's good man
you're starting to lighten up
you been sitting there
all serious and shit
man i've just been
sitting here thinking
about what
about the miracle we witnessed
the miracle you witnessed
i witnessed a freak occurrence
what is a miracle vincent
an act of god
and what's an act of god
when um
god makes the impossible
possible
but this morning
i don't think qualifies
hey vincent
don't you see
that shit don't matter
you're judging this shit
the wrong way
i mean it could be
god stopped the bullets
or he changed coke to pepsi
he found my fucking car keys
you don't judge shit like this
based on merit
now whether or not
what we experienced
was an according to hoyle
miracle
is insignificant
but what is significant
is i felt the touch of god
god got involved
but why
well that's what's
fucking with me
i don't know why
but i can't go back to sleep
you're serious
you're really thinking
about quitting
  the life
yeah
most definitely
fuck
what you going to do then
well that's what i've been
sitting here contemplating
first i'm going to deliver
this case to marsellus
then basically i'm just
going to walk the earth
what you mean walk the earth
you know
like caine in kung fu
walk from place to place
meet people get in adventures
and how long do you intend
to walk the earth
till god puts me
where he wants me to be
and what if he don't do that
if it takes forever
then i'll walk forever
so you decided to be a bum
i'll just be jules vincent
no more no less

just like all those
pieces of shit out there

well that seems

and ringo here definitely
doesn't want that
so let's see what we can do
now
here's the situation
normally both your asses

to pull this shit
while i'm in
a transitional period
and i don't want to kill you
i want to help you
but i can't give you this case
'cause it don't belong to me

how much is there
about $1500

that makes this a pretty
successful little score
jules you give
that fuckin' nimrod $1500
and i'll shoot him
on general principle
no yolanda yolanda
he ain't gonna do a goddamn
motherfuckin' thing
vince shut the fuck up
shut up
come on yolanda
stay with me baby
now i ain't givin' it to him
vincent
i'm buyin' somethin'
for my money
wanna know what i'm buyin'
ringo
what
your life
i'm givin' you that money
so i don't have
to kill your ass
you read the bible ringo
not regularly no
well there's this passage
i got memorized
ezekiel 2517
the path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides
by the inequities
of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will
shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness
for he is truly
his brother's keeper
and the finder
of lost children
and i will strike down
upon thee
with great vengeance
and furious anger
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers
and you will know
i am the lord
when i lay my vengeance
upon you
now i been sayin'
that shit for years
and if you heard it
that meant your ass
i never gave much thought
to what it meant
i just thought
it was some cold blooded shit
to say to a motherfucker before
i popped a cap in his ass
but i saw some shit this mornin'
made me think twice
see now i'm thinkin'
maybe it means
you're the evil man
and i'm the righteous man
and mr nine millimeter here
he's the shepherd
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness
or it could mean
you're the righteous man
and i'm the shepherd
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish
now i'd like that
but that shit ain't the truth
the truth is
you're the weak
and i am the tyranny
of evil men
but i'm tryin' ringo
i'm tryin' real hard
to be the shepherd
go on
i think we should
be leaving now
yeah
that's probably a good idea
