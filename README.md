# Smoovie

[Smoovie](https://smoovie.app) is a lightweight web app which allows users to analyse metrics related to the words and phrases said throughout their favourite movies, in the form of nice, interactive charts showcasing the data.  

There are approximately 25,000 english moovies currently released. That's quite a lot. 

Thankfully, with the use of the [IMDb API](https://imdb-api.com/) and the [OpenSubtitles API](https://opensubtitles.stoplight.io/docs/opensubtitles-api), Smoovie is able to analyse almost all of them (some haven't been added to the OpenSubtitles database yet).
