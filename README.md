# Smoovie

[Smoovie](https://smoovie.app) is a lightweight, responsive web app which allows users to analyse metrics related to all the words and phrases said throughout particular movies, in the form of interactive charts showcasing the data.  

The backend was engineered using SpringBoot and the frontend was engineered using ReactJS. Both the frontend and backend applications are deployed on the Google Cloud Platform App Engine.

Smoovie uses 2 public APIs to obtain the subtitle data: the [IMDb API](https://imdb-api.com/) and the [OpenSubtitles API](https://opensubtitles.stoplight.io/docs/opensubtitles-api).
